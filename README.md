A batch framework, to handle everyday tasks and more...

//Tip move Framwork.bat to system32 to call the framework from anywhere.

#To make a command
Simply type: make *name of new command* (no .bat)
An empty .bat file with the name will be created, and opened for you to start coding.

#Class feature

using: class *name of new class* 
after that it will ask you to write a name of a new function

let say we have a class called test and a function called fun

call them by writing: test->fun

#wifiPassFinder
